DandyID provides one place to manage you and your relationships online.

== Description ==

DandyID is a free service that connects all of your online identities and makes them globally accessible. Your e-mail address serves as a single access point to your Flickr, Twitter, LinkedIn, and much more -- services being added daily!

The DandyID Services Wordpress plugin dynamically accesses your DandyID services, and displays them in a sidebar widget.
