== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How often does the plugin retrieve my list of DandyID services ? =

The plugin retrieves your DandyID services only once per day.  This is for performance reasons, and helps pages load much faster.

= If I update my services on DandyID, does the plugin wait until the next day to retrieve them ?

Yes. But, you can force a refresh, by going to *Settings->DandyID Services* in WordPress admin, and pressing the *Save* button.
