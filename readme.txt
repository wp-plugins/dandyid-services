= What is the DandyID Services Plugin ? =

The plugin accesses your DandyID online identities and displays them in a sidebar widget, making all of your online identities accessible to your blog readers!

**When you update your services on DandyID, they are updated in your sidebar widget automatically!**

*Note: The plugin uses a caching mechanism, reducing page-load times, by only retrieving your DandyID online identity list ONCE per day (at most). This occurs the first time your blog is accessed on any given day.*
