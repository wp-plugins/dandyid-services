== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**How often does the Plugin retrieve my list of DandyID services ?**

Your DandyID services are retrieved once every 2 hours. This aids performance to help blog pages load faster.

**If I update my services on DandyID, does the Plugin wait until the next 2-hour interval to retrieve them ?**

Yes. But you can initiate a refresh at any time by going to **Settings->DandyID Services**, and pressing the **Save** button.

**What is the purpose of the "Theme-alignment NEEDS FIX" setting on the options page?**

After activating the plugin, a small number of users have observed:

  - Misaligned posts
  - Missing content
  - Plugins that have disappeared
  - Footer either missing or misaligned

This setting corrects a problem in some themes that precede the DandyID sidebar with an opening DIV tag, but fail to generate the corresponding closing DIV tag.

When "Theme-alignment NEEDS FIX" is chosen, the DandyID plugin generates a closing DIV tag.

**What languages are currently supported on the settings page ?**

  - Chinese
  - French
  - German
  - Hebrew
  - Italian
  - Polish
  - Russian
  - Slovak
  - Spanish (sp)
  - Spanish (mx)

**Known Issues and Workarounds**

1. Fatal error: Call to undefined function: curl_init()
   - The CURL PHP library needs to be installed.
   - [Please see these setup instructions](http://php.net/manual/en/curl.setup.php) for more info.
